**Data Source:**
Extracted data on matches and World Cup details from www.espncricinfo.com, and gathered information on players' career performance from BrightData.

**Data Collection:**
Utilized Beautiful Soup library and Jupyter Notebook to scrape data from BrightData. Converted the obtained JSON files into dataframes in Jupyter Notebook and then saved these dataframes as CSV files for further analysis in Power BI.

**Data Transformation:** 
Conducted initial data cleaning post-scraping, including tasks such as correcting player names, handling missing values, and linking match IDs using Pandas. Transformed the final dataset for dashboard creation using Power Query in Power BI.

**Data Modeling:**
Established connections between datasets based on defined primary keys like team and match IDs. Additionally, formulated various measures, calculated columns, and parameters using DAX for comprehensive data analysis and dashboard creation in Power BI.

Data visualization for the dataset is done using Power BI :
